From the analysis we can infer the following conclusions:
*BMI contributes to heart disease.
    People with BMI less than 20 or greater than 25 tend to have a higher chance
    of getting heart disease.
*Smoking habits contributes to heart disease. On the other hand,
    the data shows that alcoholic drinking habits does not contribute to heart disease,
    which is quite counter-intuitive.
*Stroke contributes to heart disease.
*The number of physical health problems experienced within
    the past 30 days contributes to heart disease. On the other hand, the data
    shows that the number of mental health problems within the same interval only
    gives a small contribution to heart disease.
*People with difficulty walking tend to have a higher chance of
    getting heart disease.
*In terms of sexes, males tend to have a higher chance of heart disease
    than females.
*The number of physical activity other than working in the past 30 days decreases
    the chance of getting heart disease. The same conclusion applies for the general
    health conditions.
*The amount of sleep time in a day does not seem to give
    a considerable contribution to heart disease.
    However, people without heart disease commonly have a better sleep time,
    that is about 6 to 8 hours in a day.
*Asthma, kidney disease, skin cancer and diabetes contribute to heart disease.
    However, asthma only gives a small contribution.
*People older than 60 tend to have heart disease than those younger than 60.
*Race does not seem to have constributions to heart disease.
    People of any race could have heart disease.
